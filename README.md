# Development Exercise
This exercise evaluates a basic understanding of PHP, jQuery, HTML &amp; CSS. It makes use of the bootstrap UI framework along with the jquery javascript library. All server actions are done in PHP.

### Assignment
You will be creating a basic PHP web app that allows a user to create and modify tasks in a task list type of app. Tasks will be stored in a file as a json encoded string (for the purposes of this exercise).
The final result should be a 1 page app that displays a list of tasks and allows the user to click on a task to edit it in a modal (reference bootstrap modals). The user should also be able to create a new task from scratch as well as delete existing tasks.
* You will need to implement the jquery and html code on the frontend to display the task information
* You will need to implement the jquery code on the frontend that sends the task information to the server
* You will need to implement a PHP class that will be able to handle the modification of the task object
* You will need to implement a PHP script that receives a POST with the object information and then either updates, creates or deletes the task object

To start, fork this repo and continue within the existing code to complete the assignment.

In PHP:
* json_encode();
* json_decode();

In jQuery:
* $.post();
* Functions to update html elements on the page
